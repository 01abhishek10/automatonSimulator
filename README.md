# automatonSimulator
A website that simulates various finite state machines: DFA, NFA, PDA.

A GUI is provided to create, save/load (browser local storage), export/import (plaintext format), and debug finite state machines.

A large set of test strings can be designated to be accepted or rejected and then all tested at once.

Or, a specific string can be step-debugged to see exactly how the finite state machine would handle it.
